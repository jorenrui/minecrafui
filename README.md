# Minecrafui

A Minecraft clone that is built with ThreeJS, ReactJS and TypeScript. Read [how I built it](https://joeylene.com/blog/2022/minecrafui).

Features:
- Place/remove block
- Basic movement controls
- Basic collision detection (diagonal collision not supported yet)
- Sound effects for place and remove blocks.
- Inventory / Block Selection with keyboard shortcuts (1-9)

Stuffs needed to do:
- Loading Screen
- Terrain Generation
- Infinite World
- Inventory Modal
- First Person Model
- Mobile responsiveness
- Touch Controls for mobile

Let me suffer on making this work ;-;
